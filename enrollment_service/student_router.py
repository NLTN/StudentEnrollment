    EXAMPLE ONLY (please reimplement this endpoint)
    requirements:
        - "x-cwid", "x-first-name", "x-last-name", "x-roles" headers from krakend must be propagated

    example of dependency injection usage:
        1: "dependencies = [get_or_create_user]" -> this function retrieves or create user information based on 
            the propagated headers. (syncs with user db). user info is stored in request state
        2: get_dynamo -> abstraction to make dynamo accesible within the endpoint. the dynamo wrapper instance was 
            instantiated in app.py and already stored in the app state. this function just returns the object

            **why are we reusing the same instance of dynamo wrapper?
              - botocore has a built in db connection pool, of default 10 connections. that's why we only
                need one instance for the dynamo wrapper

        3: get_current_user -> abstraction to make current user accessible within the endpoint. this function just returns
            the user object saved in request state from get_or_create_user
